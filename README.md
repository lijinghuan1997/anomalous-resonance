# anomalous-resonance
calculate single particle trajectory

  In the program, we can change the single particle energy/ pitch angle/ phase angle in the spacecraft rest frame (FAC coordinate), which are next adjusted into plasma
rest frame. 
  Subroutines Bfield and Efield give the wave fields. 
  Subroutine outf output the particle information and save it into the FSD.txt file.

  the plot_gyrophase.m code gives an example to load data and plot the gyro-phase distribution.
